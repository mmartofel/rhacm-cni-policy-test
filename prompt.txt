I'm using Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform with Red Hat OpenShift Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes.
At the Red Hat OpenShift Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes I'm able to create policies monitoring various clusters configurations.i
Prior to version 4.14, OpenShift SDN was the default, but it has been deprecated and will no longer be supported after version 4.16, requiring migration to OVN-Kubernetes. 
My task is to create a policy:
- policy reporting all clusters using OpenShift SDN and OVN-Kubernetes
- OVN-Kubernetes clusters are compliant according to policy, OpenShift SDN are not compliant 
please help me to create a prompt to create policy that can monitor clusters with Red Hat OpenShift Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes


Create a Kubernetes policy YAML definition for Red Hat OpenShift Advanced Cluster Management (ACM) that monitors the CNI plugin used by managed clusters.

Requirements:
- The policy should check the cluster network type from the `network.operator.openshift.io` API (`ClusterNetwork` resource, spec.networkType).
- Clusters running **OVN-Kubernetes** are considered **compliant**.
- Clusters running **OpenShiftSDN** are considered **noncompliant** (since OpenShiftSDN is deprecated after OCP 4.16).
- Policy should be **inform-only** (no remediation).
- Use ACM policy format (`policy.open-cluster-management.io` API group).
- Use **Placement** (not PlacementRule) together with PlacementBinding to apply across all managed clusters.
- Provide a complete YAML manifest.

Generate production-ready YAML that works on OCP with ACM.
